                                   <h2>Here's a good question, what is "Pair Programming" ?</h2>

                                   <p>It is programming done in pairs, a working method in which to developers work together on single computer  <br><br>
                                        

                                        Thre is one who codes, and one who observes the work of the
                                         coder. As in a car, the driver dirves ( the coder ), the passenger ( the observer ) will thus be able to observe the possible risks that the driver can not see or point out to him the mistakes he makes while driving. Or simply, he advises the road to follow. <br>

                                   </p>

                                   <img src="pp.jpeg" alt="illustration">
                                   <p>So here the coder will code, while the observer will control the errors of strikes, indentation, or design and give it alternatives. This makes him a second eye and a second way of thinking or seeing the code. It is advisable to alternate the roles in order to optimize the rendering.<br><br>
                                        

                                        Pair programming is part of the best practices of extrem programming.<br><br>
                                        
                                   </p>
                                   <h2>Why do "Pair Programming" ?</h2><br><br>

                                   <h3>Quality and productivity</h3><br>
                                   <img src="kimmanjin.svg" alt="calcul">
                                   <p>
                                        According to Kim Man Lui and his REAP calculation, a pair usue exactly half the time needed for a single programmer for the same task. it is therefore useful for reducing a delivery time for example. <br><br> 

                                        It allows bug detection much more easily, usually a binomial will perform a task ultimately more reliable than a programmer alone. <br><br>

                                        Economically, the additional staffing induced by the pair programming is offset by the increase in quality of the application produced. The more late a bug is found, the more expensive it is to correct it.<br><br>
                                   </p>
                                   <h3>Quality and productivity</h3><br>
                                   <p>
                                        The pair programming is a group work,  it promotes constant communication for the team to provide consistent work. According to several surveys, 90% of programmers say they prefer working in pairs.<br><br>

                                        In "education", programming in pairs allows the weaker to better understand and therefore not to hang on something that does not understand .. This also allows to have a good relationship with the student but also with the teacher.<br><br>

                                        In a company, we also see the sharing of technical knowledge between programmers.<br><br>
                                   </p>
                                   <h3>Errors not to be done in pair programming</h3><br>
                                   <p>
                                        <b>Silence</b>: it does not exist in a binomial, on the contrary, the two programmers must communicate in order to exchange all the useful information for the task at hand.<br><br>

                                        <b>Disengagement</b>: it's a binomial .. If only one person works while the other plays on his phone. It will not work ... <br><br>

                                        <b>Erasing</b>: if I come across more talented than me. I must not put myself aside, I must ask questions, take notes or give ideas. On the other hand if I am more talented, I must explain, advise. <br><br>

                                        Of course, if two people do not get along, the pair programming is of no use.<br><br>

                                        It is possible to work remotely. Skype, discord or other for commnication, and Mikogo for screen sharing. But network breaks can make it difficult. An evolution is possible: a coder code, it pushes on GIT, I corrects the push while he continues to code on his side.
